# Computer-Store-Shopping-App
An E-commerce Android app project written in Kotlin for my CSIT335 Human Computer Interaction class in Montclair State University.

The code I mainly wrote in were in four Kotlin files (.kt files) in the path: 
- app/src/main/java/com/example/computerstoreshoppingapp

The four Kotlin files I primarily worked on are:
- MainActivity.kt
- Item.kt
- Review.kt
- User.kt

The item images I used are in: app/src/main/res/drawable

The rest are project build scripts and other files made by Android Studio for the app project.

Due to time constraints of having to work on various assignments this semester including this one, the UI of these screens could admittedly look better but they're serviceable for now. They're viewable in the Screenshots folder.
