# Computer-Store-Shopping-App
An E-commerce Android app project written in Kotlin for my CSIT335 Human Computer Interaction class in Montclair State University.

* The code I mainly wrote in were in four Kotlin files (.kt files) in the path: app/src/main/java/com/example/computerstoreshoppingapp

* The four Kotlin files I primarily worked on are:
- MainActivity.kt
- Item.kt
- Review.kt
- User.kt

* The item images I used are in:
app/src/main/res/drawable

* The rest are project build scripts and other files made by Android Studio for the app project.

* Due to time constraints of having to work on various assignments this semester including this one, the UI of these screens could admittedly look better but they're serviceable for now.
